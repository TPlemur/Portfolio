Due to not owning any of the IP involved this game is a one off, but it was an interesting experiment in how to balance the intuition of movement with stylization from a source IP. The iteration I settled on has 10 targets, with no more that 15 moves required to get to them from any space on the board, but in the process I used some interesting graph theory tools to assist in the design of the board, allowing more complex boards to be created with relative ease.</li>
